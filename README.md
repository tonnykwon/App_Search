By YoungJu Kwon

## Documenation:
Summary
This application is to search personalized app based on the app installation information. App embedding is created through using word2vec algorithm, which is believed to show better presentations of appsâ€™ characteristics than their categories. Combined with the embedding, the project will retrieve personalized app search results for the query given. Other than that, it would suggest basic search result for cold start.
